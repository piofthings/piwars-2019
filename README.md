~~Mind you we haven't~~ We have qualified for the competition ~~yet~~ . ~~We haven't even applied. We are just getting ready. Hopefully we'll have a strong application before September 23rd deadline and we'll be selected to compete in the main event.~~

This repository will contain all the code for our 'not yet publicly named' Robot.
